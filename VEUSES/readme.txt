VEUSES

1. About VEUSES

EUSES is the most frequently used spreadsheet corpus, and contains 4,037 spreadsheets. These spreadsheets were extracted from World Wide Web. 
We applied SpreadCluster to the EUSES and manually validated all groups. Based on the validated result, we built the VEUSES corpus, containing 177 evolution groups and 363 spreadsheets.
VEUSES is published associated with our MSR 2017 paper in May 2017. 
Please use the data only for teaching and research purposes. Should you have any questions, please contact Wensheng Dou (wsdou@otcaix.iscas.ac.cn).
